# Agile Flex

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip 3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)

## Installation

To install the project's dependencies run:

```sh
pipenv install
```

## Execution

To activate the project's environment run:

```sh
pipenv shell
```

If you do not have the required python version install you will be prompted to install it.

This will load the correct version of Python into your shell. From there you can run scripts using `python {script-name}.py`.
